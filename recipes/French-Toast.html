    <p> This french toast is going to defy all of your
        current expectations surrounding all breakfast items.
        It will be sweet, warm, fluffy, chewy, and ultimately
        amazing. You will experience a culinary combination like
        non other from your past. You will be let down by all other
        breakfasts you have from this point going forward. I promise
        you that you will hate me for this. good luck.
    </p>
