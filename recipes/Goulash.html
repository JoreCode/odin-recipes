    <p>This Goulash is going to blow your brains out like a 
        12 gauge shotgun after a horrifically depressive episode
        immediately after your current girlfriend breaks up with you.
        You will experience a comfort food so drenched with falvor and
        nostalgia that you will wish you were 8 years ago again. It 
        is so easy and straight forward that even after banging your head
        on the wall 16 times you can do it blindfolded. Enjoy.
    </p>

    <h2>Lets make da goulashi</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all of your ingredients</li>
        <li>Heat your oil in a pot over medium-high
            heat. Add the gorund beef and onion; cook and
            stir until your BEEF is browned and crumbly and 
            nice and the onion is translucent. This might be
            like 5 minutes. Dont rush it. Continue to cook and 
            stir until liquid is evaporated, another maybe 5. 
            Add garlic, bay leaves, paprika, italian seasoning,
            salt, black pepper, and cayenne.
        </li>
        <li>Cook, stirring every now and again, until those amazing
            flavors really get to know each other. They only need like
            3 minutes dont worry. Pour in the broth, marinara, and
            diced tomatoes. Pour water into the sauce jar and swirl 
            to get the rest of that stuff you already bought. Stir 
            in the soy sauce; bring it to a simmer. Reduce the heat
            to medium and simmer until the flavors get wild, this is 
            like 30. So put on a show or some shit. 
        </li>
        <li>Go back to medium high and bring to a rapid simmer. stir
            in the macaroni; cook, stirring here and there, until barely
            tender. Thats like 12 minutes. Check for doneness after 10.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from the heat, take out the bay leaves, stir in the cheddar
            and parsely. Cover for 5, taste it, season it however you like, and 
            enjoy it because is pretty fricking good.
