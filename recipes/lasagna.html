    <h3>Let's cook this hoe</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Cook sausage, beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven
            over medium heat until browned. Stur in crushed Tomato,
            tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar 
            to make it sweet like your sister, 2 tbsp parsely, Basil,
            1 tsp salt, italian seasoning, fennel, and pepper. Simmer, 
            covered, for like 1.5 hours, stir every now and then like a 
            good boy.
        </li>

        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, make it salty
            like you after I hang out with your mom. Cook lasagna Noodles 
            in the water for like 8 minutes. Drain those noods, rinse with
            cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine the rigot with egg, the
            last of the parsely, and 1/2 tsp salt.
        </li>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 375F (190C if you are a commie) </li>

        <li>Now lets build this. Spread 1.5 cups of my meat in the bottom
            of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noods lengthwise over 
            my meat. Spread (like your mom) with half the rigot. Top with 1/3
            of muzz slices. Spoon (like i do with your sister) 1.5 of my meat
            over the muzz, and sprinkle 1/4 cup Parm. Repeat the layers and 
            finish it off with teh muzz and parm. Cover with foil. If you dont
            want it to stick (which you shouldnt cuz you arent literally stupid)
            spray the foil with cooking spray.
        </li>

        <li>Last step. Pop that sucker in the oven for 25 solid minutes. Remove
            the foil and bake for ANOTHER 25 minutes. Let it rest for 15 after that.
            Youll wanna dive in, but if you do everything will fall apart like
            your parents marriage. Be patient. The nut is worth it.
        </li>
